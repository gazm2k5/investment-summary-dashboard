# IG.com Investment Summary Dashboard
A script to take the transaction and trade history .csv files generated by IG.com and produce an interactive dashboard to summarise investments.

The script mostly uses Dash, Pandas to create a dashboard of datatables. It calculates profit and loss on individual positions, as well as totaling things like dividends and fees.

The purpose of this tool is to make end of year accounting slightly easier, giving a quick summary rather than having to look through the mostly unhelpful csv files produced by IG.com and having to manually calculate profit and loss.
